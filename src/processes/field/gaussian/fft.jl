    FFTMethod(; [paramaters])

The FFT Gaussian process method introduced by Gutjahr 1997.
The covariance function is perturbed in the frequency domain
after a fast Fourier transform. White noise is added to the
phase of the spectrum, and a realization is produced by an
inverse Fourier transform.

## Parameters
* `minneighbors` - Minimum number of neighbors (default to `1`)
* `maxneighbors` - Maximum number of neighbors (default to `10`)
* `neighborhood` - Search neighborhood (default to `nothing`)
* `distance`     - Distance used to find nearest neighbors (default to `Euclidean()`)

## References

  Fourier transform method](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02769641)

### Notes

* The method is limited to simulations on Cartesian grids, and care must be
  taken to make sure that the correlation length is small enough compared to
  the grid size.

* As a general rule of thumb, avoid correlation lengths greater than 1/3 of
  the grid.

* The method is extremely fast, and can be used to generate large 3D realizations.
